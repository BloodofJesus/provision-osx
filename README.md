provision-osx
=============

A batch file to provision OS X as a virtual machine host.

The goal is to disable as many services as possible, while leaving the system usable and stable. Current numbers show memory usage without anyone logged in of "PhysMem: 1150M used (606M wired), 7040M unused." But I think this number could go even lower.
